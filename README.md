# StarBox
Mod named StarBox for testing unit compositions.

Created with Blizzard Entertainment's Starcraft 2 Galaxy Editor.

The mod was originally named "Unit Test Lab", and like all my mods scores a high grade in the battle.net arcade. I have done my best to make sure there are no bugs, but I have not fully tested multiplayer compatibility so I strongly recommend you only use the mode for single-player testing. The command button menu should be enough to provide for a good test, otherwise an AI can be implemented that can simulate a pro player.

With the help of this I managed to earn a high diamond in the competitive ranks with an estimated win ratio of 90%.

These and more are available in-game.
## Future
I won't be updating the mod further. The last update I made was in 2016, but since it has untouched dependencies it should more or less update itself. 

Anyone is free to further develop the mod.
